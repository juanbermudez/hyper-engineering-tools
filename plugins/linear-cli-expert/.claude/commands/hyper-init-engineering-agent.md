# Initialize Engineering Agent for This Codebase

You are tasked with customizing the **engineering-agent** located at `.claude/agents/engineering-agent.md` for this specific codebase.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the project is initialized first:
- Run `/hyper-setup` if you haven't already
- Verify `.claude/agents/engineering-agent.md` exists

## Your Task

Use **2-4 sub-agents** to perform parallel research on development practices and technical patterns.

Begin the initialization process now. Launch 2-4 sub-agents in parallel using the Task tool to research: (1) Tech stack & build tools, (2) Testing & quality practices, (3) Code patterns & conventions, (4) Development workflow.

After synthesis, update `.claude/agents/engineering-agent.md` with codebase-specific practices.
