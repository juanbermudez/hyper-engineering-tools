# Initialize Planning Agent for This Codebase

You are tasked with customizing the **planning-agent** located at `.claude/agents/planning-agent.md` for this specific codebase and Linear workspace.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the project is initialized first:
- Run `/hyper-setup` if you haven't already
- Verify `.claude/agents/planning-agent.md` exists

## Your Task

Use **2-4 sub-agents** to perform parallel research on planning workflows and Linear workspace configuration.

Begin the initialization process now. Launch 2-4 sub-agents in parallel using the Task tool to research: (1) Linear workspace config, (2) Project/issue patterns, (3) Task breakdown practices, (4) Documentation patterns.

After synthesis, update `.claude/agents/planning-agent.md` with workspace-specific configurations.
